# Joomla + MySQL via Docker (Afeka vLab Setup)

This project allows you to run a Joomla website with MySQL using Docker containers. It's designed for vLab environments where data isn't persistent.

Group Members: Niv Kalbo, Ori Israelov, Tamir Eliasy

What we did
Created a Docker Network
Ran the command:

docker network create ProjectNetwork
to set up an internal network between the containers.

Created a docker-compose.yml File
Defined Joomla and MySQL containers with network, volumes, and environment variables for passwords.

Started the Website and Created Users
Ran the site via Docker, accessed the admin panel, and created an admin user as well as other users.

Added Content to the Site
Wrote articles and pages inside the Joomla interface.

Backed Up the MySQL Database
Performed backups of the database using Docker commands and mysqldump.

Wrote Management Scripts
Developed scripts for managing the project:

setup.sh ‚Äî setup and start environment

backup.sh ‚Äî create backups

restore.sh ‚Äî restore from backups

cleanup.sh ‚Äî clean up environment (stop containers, remove volumes and files)

Challenges Faced
Backup and Restore Issues:
We encountered difficulties restoring the database backup due to permission errors and the need for correct MySQL user privileges.

Ensuring the backup file (my-joomla.backup.sql.gz) was correctly decompressed and imported inside the MySQL container required precise command syntax and passing the correct credentials.

Additionally, syncing Joomla files with the database backup to maintain site consistency was a challenge, solved by carefully managing Docker volumes and mount points.

Troubleshooting Docker container networking and volume mounting was necessary to allow Joomla to connect correctly to the MySQL database after restore.
